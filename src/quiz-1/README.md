## QUIZ #1

### Summary

While browsing on Etherscan you come accross these old contracts (who uses uniswap v2 anymore ^^).

Each user can deploy its vault (or multiple) using the factory, then each vault can add strategies.
It seems like some users used the Univ2 strategy, approved and added liquidity. 

While they're not using these vaults and strategy anymore, their wallets are still active.
